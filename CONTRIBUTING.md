# Contributing 

Thanks for your interest on contributing to reference 👍👍, it's people like you that make [QuickRef.ME](https://quickref.me) such a amazing site 🎉🎉. Feel free to [submit issues](https://github.com/Randy8080/reference/issues/new?assignee=Randy8080) and enhancement requests. 

A `{filename}.md` file will be processed into a cheat sheet, let's create or edit a markdown file:

#### Front Matter
```markdown
---
title: QuickRef
date: 2020-11-25 18:28:43
icon: icon-style
background: bg-green-600
tags:
categories:
    - Other
intro: This is a reference of styles that you can use on quickref cheatsheets!
---
```
Just need `title` and `intro`, and ignore other options. I will complete it if it can be released.

#### CSS classes
QuickRefs uses [markdown-it-attrs](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs) and supports adding classes via its syntax. Also, there is a reference of styles that you can use on `quickref.me` cheat sheets:  https://quickref.me/quickref


At last, It's a good practice to refer to the source code of the existing cheat sheet!
